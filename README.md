# Flappy-Chicken
My first experience with Scratch
As my first exercice in CS50, I was challenged to create something on Scratch.mit.edu... And I need to say it was fun! I was able to create anything I wanted, even thou my daughter wanted me to create a "pac-man" style game and I ended up with this:

https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/714970955/

This project needs a bit of attention, of course, but it's my first one.
I'll be happy if you can give me feedback or say something that will help me along the way
